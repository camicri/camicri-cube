# Installing Packages

In this guide I'll show you how to transfer back your project, update outdated repositories, and install new packages.


## Transferring Project

On `cube/projects` folder, delete the old project and replace it with the new project.

## Updating Computer's Repository

Since we have downloaded new repositories, we need to update our computer's outdated repositories first before installing new packages.

Click `Cube => System => Update Computer's Repositories`.

A dialog will appear asking for your credentials. Note that this dialog is from your computer and not from Cube.

!> Package installation may fail if you don't update your computer's repositories first. This is beacuse your computer's record on the package is outdated and will not match with the new package.

## Installing Package Updates

To install all updates, click `Cube => Install => Mark All Downloaded for Installation` 

And then click `Cube => Install => Install All Marked Packages` to install them.

!> Note that Cube might prevent installation of some apps with packages that needs to be downloaded. To install packages with satisfied downloaded packages, click `Cube => Install => Install All Satisfied Downloaded Packages`
