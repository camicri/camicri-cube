# Downloading Packages

A **package** is a compressed archive containing your application data. An application may have one or more packages. Cube will automatically determine which packages should be downloaded for your application.

Before we begin downloading specific packages, let's download first all packages that needs to be updated.

It is essential that you update your packages on a regular basis. This is to have their new features, prevent conflicts when installing new packages, and for security. Highly recommended to newly installed Linux system.
